## What does the random words mean the creep at the controller is shouting?

The controller creep spits out the friendly "Don't like" list. If you are on
the list the AI considers you as unfriendly und will you treat like this.

## How can I get of the "Don't like" list?

If you transfer resources to one of my terminals, the idiot value will be
decreased. You can see the value as credits and the calculation is based
on the market price of the resources you send.
